This essay_will not consider_the problems_concerning the future_of teaching_the art of writing_in the face_of the growing importance_of nonliterate messages_in our surroundings,_although those problems_will become_ever more important_both_in the so-called developed countries_and_in societies_where illiteracy_is still_widespread.
Instead,_it_proposes_to consider_a tendency_that_underlies_those problems:_namely,_the tendency_away from linear codes_such as writing_and_toward_two-dimensional codes_such as photographs, films, and TV,_a tendency_that_may be observed_if_one_glances_even superficially_at the codified world_that_surrounds_us.
The future_of writing,_of that gesture_which_aligns_symbols_to produce texts,_must be seen_against the background_of that tendency.
