This essay will not consider the problems concerning the future of teaching the art of writing in the face of the growing importance of nonliterate messages in our surroundings, although those problems will become ever more important both in the so-called developed countries and in societies where illiteracy is still widespread.
<ub>
Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency away from linear codes such as writing and toward two-dimensional codes such as photographs, films, and TV, a tendency that may be observed if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us.
</ub>
The future of writing, of that gesture which aligns symbols to produce texts, must be seen against the background of that tendency.

Writing is an important gesture, because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called “historical consciousness,” History began with the invention of writing, not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive symbols, by writing.
</ub>
<ub>
The difference between prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there are literate men who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a “becoming,” whereas in prehistory no such existential attitude is possible.
</ub>
If the art of writing were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become subservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” in films), history in the strict sense of that term would be over.

If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the original purpose of writing was to facilitate the deciphering of images.
Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus.
<ub>
The “cuneiform” symbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they ac­ company.
They “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it.
</ub>
They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text, by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within the image.
It may be shown through text analysis that the original purpose of writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a single dimension, is still there: every text, even a very abstract one, means, in the last analysis, an image.
<sb/>

The translation from surface into line implies a radical change of meaning.
The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus establishes reversible relations between the elements of the image.
It may go back and forth while deciphering the image.
This reversibility of relations that prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who use images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it.
For them, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a reversible way, and their world is structured by “eternal return.”
It is just as true to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing follows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as that death follows life.
The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as much as the rising sun calls the cock to crow.
In such a world, circular time orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced it will be readjusted by time itself.
Because to live is to displace things, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged in time.
This demands that man propitiate the order of the world, the “gods” of which it is full.
In sum: the “imagined” world is the world of myth, of magic, the prehistorical world.
<sb/>

The eye that deciphers a text follows its lines, and thus establishes the univocal relation of a chain between the elements of which the text is composed.
Those who use texts to understand the world, those who “conceive” it, mean a world with a linear structure.
Everything in such a world follows from something, time flows irreversibly from the past toward the future, each instant lost is lost forever, and there is no repetition.
Each day is different from every other day, each sowing has its own characteristics, if there is life after death it must be a new sort of life, and the links of the causal chain cannot be exchanged one for the other.
In such a world, every human act is unique, and man is responsible for it.
The elements of such a world are, at least theoretically, distinct from each other like the beads on a string, and they can be counted.
On the other hand, the string that orders the beads, the “univocal flow of time,” is what holds such a world together.
In sum: the “conceived” world is the world of the religions, of salvation, of political commitment, of science, and of technology – the historical world.

One may well ask why, six thousand years ago, the effort was made to substitute the world of conception for the world of imagination, why writing was invented.
One may ask this at present precisely because a “new civilization of images” seems to be dawning.
The answer is, of course: because, six thousand years ago, some people thought that some images needed explaining.
Images are mediations between man and his world, a world that has become inaccessible to him immediately.
They are tools to overcome human alienation: they are meant to permit action in a world in which man no longer lives immediately but that he faces.
Cave paintings are meant to permit hunting of ponies, cathedral windows to permit praying to God, road maps to permit motoring, and statistical projections to permit decision making.
One must learn how to decipher those images, one must learn the conventions that give them their meaning, and one may commit mistakes.
For instance: it would be a mistake to decipher road maps as if they were cave paintings (magic for hunting tourists), or as if they were projections (proposals to build roads).
The “imagination” that produces road maps is not the same as the “imagination” that produces cave paintings and projections.
Explaining images with the help of texts may therefore be useful.
<sb/>

<ub>
But there is yet another, and more profound, reason for the invention of writing and of historical consciousness.
</ub>
There is in images, as in all mediations, a curious inherent dialectic.
<ub>
The purpose of images is to mean the world, but they may become opaque to the world and cover it, even substitute for it.
</ub>
They may come to constitute an imaginary world that no longer mediates between man and the world, but, on the contrary, imprisons man.
Imagination no longer overcomes alienation, but becomes hallucination, or double alienation.
<ub>
No longer are such images tools, but man himself becomes a tool of his own tools; he “adores” the images he himself has produced.
</ub>
It is against this idolatry of images, as a therapy against this double alienation, that writing was invented.
The early writers in our tradition – the prophets, for instance – knew this by committing themselves against idols and idol making.
And so did Plato when he announced his hatred of what we now call the “plastic arts.”
Writing, historical consciousness, linear, rational thought were invented to save humankind from “ideologies,” from hallucinatory imagination.
