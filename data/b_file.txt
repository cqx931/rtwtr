This essay will not consider the problems concerning the future of teaching the art of writing in the face of the growing importance of nonliterate messages in our surroundings_,_ although those problems will become ever more important both in the so_-_called developed countries and in societies where illiteracy is still widespread_._
<ub>
Instead_,_ it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems_:_ namely_,_ the tendency away from linear codes such as writing and toward two_-_dimensional codes such as photographs_,_ films_,_ and TV_,_ a tendency that may be observed if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us_._
</ub>
The future of writing_,_ of that gesture which aligns symbols to produce texts_,_ must be seen against the background of that tendency_._

Writing is an important gesture_,_ because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called _“_historical consciousness_,__”_ History began with the invention of writing_,_ not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past_,_ but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not perceived as a process_,_ _“_historically_,__”_ unless one signifies it by successive symbols_,_ by writing_._
</ub>
<ub>
The difference between prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter_,_ but that during history there are literate men who experience_,_ understand_,_ and evaluate the world as a _“_becoming_,__”_ whereas in prehistory no such existential attitude is possible_._
</ub>
If the art of writing were to fall into oblivion_,_ or if it were to become subservient to picture making _(_as in the _“_scriptwriting_”_ in films_)__,_ history in the strict sense of that term would be over_._

If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles_,_ one can see that the original purpose of writing was to facilitate the deciphering of images_._
Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and _“_cuneiform_”_ symbols scratched into them with a stylus_._
<ub>
The _“_cuneiform_”_ symbols form lines_,_ and they obviously mean the image they ac­ company_._
They _“_explain_,__”_ _“_recount_,__”_ _“_tell_”_ it_._
</ub>
They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines_,_ by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text_,_ by rendering _“_explicit_”_ what was _“_implicit_”_ within the image_._
It may be shown through text analysis that the original purpose of writing_,_ namely_,_ the transcoding of two_-_dimensional codes into a single dimension_,_ is still there_:_ every text_,_ even a very abstract one_,_ means_,_ in the last analysis_,_ an image_._
