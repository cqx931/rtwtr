This _“_writing through_”_ of Vilém Flusser_’_s _‘_The Future of Writing_,__’_ reconfiguring it so as to become John Cayley_’_s _‘_The Future of Language_,__’_ will not consider problems concerning any possible future for the teaching or philosophizing of an art of language in the face of the growing importance of non_-_ or anti_-_linguistic messages in our surroundings_,_ although those problems have already become significant in the so_-_called developed countries_._
<ub>
Instead_,_ it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems_:_ namely_,_ the tendency to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language _(_as perceptible phenomenon_)_ and toward multi_-_dimensional codes such as photographs_,_ films_,_ TV_,_ screen_-_based graphic design in the service of social and socialized media_,_ and_,_ generally_,_ a conception of art and aesthetics that is dominated by visuality_,_ by so_-_called _“_fine_”_ as _“_visual_”_ or _“_plastic_”_ art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or _“_post_-_medium condition_”_ which could_,_ in principle if not in practice_,_ be extended to the arts of language_._
This distrust and denial may be observed everywhere if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us_._
Literature is $50bn behind art_._
The MoMAs in every province and metropolis are stuffed to their gills with hipsters_,_ gleeful families and young _“_artists_”_ while fewer and fewer deserted book malls provide desultory subterranean spaces for retiree reading groups_._
</ub>
The _“_future_”_ of language_,_ or rather_,_ of those gestures which align symbols to produce our shared_,_ collective_,_ readable utterances_,_ must be seen against the background of a long_-_standing tendency to distrust their alignment_._
<sb/>

<ub>
All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language_,_ all these gestures_,_ regardless of their perceptible support media are archi_-_writing in Jacques Derrida_’_s sense_._
Iterable traces of actual language_,_ all words are writing_,_ as Derrida showed us_._
There is always and only the _“_logic of the supplement_”_ with respect to the perceptible traces of language_,_ typically and genetically supported by aurality_;_ by cultural predominance_,_ _“_historically_”_ supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality_._
</ub>
<pb/>
<ub>
The configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing is an important subsidiary configuration of linguistic gesture_,_ because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called _“_historical consciousness_.__”_
History began with the authoritative emergence of writing in visuality_,_ not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past_,_ but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not necessarily perceived as a process_,_ _“_historically_,__”_ unless one signifies it by successive symbols that persist as writing_._
_“_Writing_”_ in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous_._
The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted by oral cultures – are every bit as _“_historical_”_ as the effects of literal or letteral writing_._
This follows_,_ clearly and simply_,_ from post_-_Derridean thought_._
Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi_-_writing in aurality_._
</ub>
<ub>
The difference between so_-_called prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter_,_ but that during history there are literate persons who experience_,_ understand_,_ and evaluate the world as a _“_becoming_.__”_
In what we prejudicially call _“_prehistory_”_ this kind of existential_,_ historical attitude has a different extension and scale with respect to the sum of human culture_._
</ub>
If the art of writing _(_in either sense_,_ post_-_Derridean or conventional_)_ were to fall into oblivion_,_ or if it were to become subservient to picture making _(_as in the _“_scriptwriting_”_ of films_)__,_ history in the conventional _(_historically emergent_)_ sense of that term would be over_,_ and perhaps it is_._
<sb/>

If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles_,_ one can see that the purpose of this early conventional writing was to facilitate the reading of images_._
Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and _“_cuneiform_”_ symbols scratched into them with a stylus_._
<ub>
The _“_cuneiform_”_ symbols form lines_,_ and they obviously mean the image they accompany_._
They _“_explain_,__”_ _“_recount_,__”_ _“_tell_”_ it_._
They provide it with an evocalization_._
</ub>
They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines_,_ by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text_,_ the vocabulary of an utterance_,_ by rendering _“_explicit_”_ what was _“_implicit_”_ within the image_._
It may be shown through text analysis_,_ through reading_,_ that the purpose of such writing_,_ namely_,_ the transcoding of two_-_dimensional codes into a single dimension_,_ is still there_:_ Every text_,_ every utterance_,_ even a very abstract one_,_ also means_,_ in the last analysis_,_ an image_._
