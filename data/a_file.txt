This “writing through” of Vilém Flusser’s ‘The Future of Writing,’ reconfiguring it so as to become John Cayley’s ‘The Future of Language,’ will not consider problems concerning any possible future for the teaching or philosophizing of an art of language in the face of the growing importance of non- or anti-linguistic messages in our surroundings, although those problems have already become significant in the so-called developed countries.
<ub>
Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language (as perceptible phenomenon) and toward multi-dimensional codes such as photographs, films, TV, screen-based graphic design in the service of social and socialized media, and, generally, a conception of art and aesthetics that is dominated by visuality, by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or “post-medium condition” which could, in principle if not in practice, be extended to the arts of language.
This distrust and denial may be observed everywhere if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us.
Literature is $50bn behind art.
The MoMAs in every province and metropolis are stuffed to their gills with hipsters, gleeful families and young “artists” while fewer and fewer deserted book malls provide desultory subterranean spaces for retiree reading groups.
</ub>
The “future” of language, or rather, of those gestures which align symbols to produce our shared, collective, readable utterances, must be seen against the background of a long-standing tendency to distrust their alignment.
<sb/>

<ub>
All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are archi-writing in Jacques Derrida’s sense.
Iterable traces of actual language, all words are writing, as Derrida showed us.
There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and genetically supported by aurality; by cultural predominance, “historically” supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.
</ub>
<pb/>
<ub>
The configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing is an important subsidiary configuration of linguistic gesture, because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called “historical consciousness.”
History began with the authoritative emergence of writing in visuality, not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not necessarily perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive symbols that persist as writing.
“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.
The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted by oral cultures – are every bit as “historical” as the effects of literal or letteral writing.
This follows, clearly and simply, from post-Derridean thought.
Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi-writing in aurality.
</ub>
<ub>
The difference between so-called prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there are literate persons who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a “becoming.”
In what we prejudicially call “prehistory” this kind of existential, historical attitude has a different extension and scale with respect to the sum of human culture.
</ub>
If the art of writing (in either sense, post-Derridean or conventional) were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become subservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” of films), history in the conventional (historically emergent) sense of that term would be over, and perhaps it is.

If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the purpose of this early conventional writing was to facilitate the reading of images.
Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus.
<ub>
The “cuneiform” symbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they accompany.
They “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it.
They provide it with an evocalization.
</ub>
They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text, the vocabulary of an utterance, by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within the image.
It may be shown through text analysis, through reading, that the purpose of such writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a single dimension, is still there: Every text, every utterance, even a very abstract one, also means, in the last analysis, an image.
<sb/>

The translation from surface into line implies a radical change of dimensionality with respect to the grasp of meaning.
The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus establishes reversible and arbitrary spatial relations between the elements of the image.
It may go back and forth while deciphering the image.
This spatiality of relations that prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who use images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it.
For them, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a reversible, spatial equivalence, and the world is structured by “eternal return.”
It is just as true to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing follows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as that death follows life.
The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as much as the rising sun calls the cock to crow.
In such a world, circular time orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced it will be readjusted by time itself.
Because to live is to displace things, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged in time.
This demands that we propitiate the order of the world, the “gods” of which it is full.
In sum: the “imagined” world is the world of myth, of magic, the ahistorical world.
<sb/>

The eye that reads a text, the ear that reads to hear and understand a voice, follows its lines, and thus establishes an evocalized relation between the elements of which the language is composed.
Those who lend authority to inscribed texts in order to understand the world, those who “conceive” it, mean a world with a linear structure.
Everything in such a world follows from something, time flows irreversibly from the past toward the future, each instant lost is lost forever, and there is no repetition.
Each day is different from every other day, each sowing has its own characteristics, if there is life after death it must be a new sort of life, and the links of the causal chain cannot be exchanged one for the other.
In such a world, every human act is unique, and we are responsible for it.
The elements of such a world are, at least theoretically, distinct from each other like the beads on a string, and they can be counted.
On the other hand, the string that orders the beads, the “univocal flow of time,” is what holds such a world together.
In sum: the “conceived” world is the world of the religions, of salvation, of political commitment, of science, and of technology – the historical world.

One may well ask why, six thousand years ago, effort was expended to substitute the world of conception for the world of imagination, why what we conventionally call writing emerged in persistent authoritative gestures of inscription.
One may ask this at present precisely because a “new civilization of image” seems to be dawning.
The answer is, of course: because people have always thought that some images needed explaining.
Images are mediations between ourselves and our world, a reality the unimaginably vast majority of which is inaccessible to human perception.
They are tools intended to overcome this fundamental human alienation: they are meant to permit action in a world in which we cannot live immediately but that we face.
Cave paintings are meant to permit hunting of ponies, cathedral windows to permit praying to God, road maps to permit motoring, and statistical projections – now reconfigured by AI – to permit decision making.
One must learn how to read those images, one must learn the conventions that give them their meaning, and one may commit mistakes.
For instance: it would be a mistake to read road maps as if they were cave paintings (magic for hunting tourists), or as if they were projections (proposals to build roads).
The “imagination” that produces road maps is not the same as the “imagination” that produces cave paintings and projections.
Explaining images with the help of persistent linguistic inscription may therefore be useful.
<sb/>

<ub>
But language is a human faculty not a tool for use.
Language will always have articulated our consciousness in the face of imagination with more or less persistence.
</ub>
There is in images, as in all mediations, a curious inherent dialectic.
<ub>
We see the world as images both literally and figuratively.
Visuality is, in a sense, opaque, and covers reality, substituting the imaginary for the real.
</ub>
Images come to constitute an imaginary world that no longer mediates between us and our world, but, on the contrary, constrains and deludes us.
Imagination does not overcome alienation; it becomes hallucination, or double alienation.
<ub>
Images do not reveal; we are what they show us.
We “adore” the images that we can see, even those images that we can see and the world does not.
</ub>
It is against this idolatry of images, as a therapy against this double alienation, that language cares for us.
Some of those who first spoke to us in our traditions – the prophets, for instance – learned this by committing themselves against idols and idol making.
And so did Plato when he announced his hatred of what we now call the “plastic arts.”
Language, human inscription, in time and the world, of what we are – language allows us to save the images and care for the imagination.
