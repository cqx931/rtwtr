_This “writing through”_of Vilém Flusser’s ‘The Future of Writing,’_reconfiguring_it_so as to become_John Cayley’s ‘The Future of Language,’_will not consider_problems_concerning any possible future_for the teaching or philosophizing_of an art_of language_in the face_of the growing importance_of non- or anti-linguistic messages_in our surroundings,_although_those problems_have already become_significant_in the so-called developed countries._<sb/>_
_Instead,_it_proposes_to consider_a tendency_that_underlies_those problems:_namely,_a tendency_to deny or distrust_the fundamental linearity_of language_(as perceptible phenomenon)_in favor_of multi-dimensional codes_such as photographs, film, television, screen-based graphic design in the service of social and socialized media,_and,_generally,_a conception_of art and aesthetics_that_is dominated_by visuality,_by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art_even_as and when_this world_of art_embraces_the conceptualism or “post-medium condition”_which_could,_in principle if not in practice,_be extended_to the arts_of language._<sb/>_
_This distrust and denial_may be observed_everywhere_if_one_glances_even superficially_at the codified world_that_surrounds_us._<sb/>_
_Literature_is_$50bn_behind art._<sb/>_
_The MoMAs_in every province and metropolis_are stuffed_to their gills_with hipsters, gleeful families and young “artists”_while_fewer and fewer deserted book malls_provide_desultory subterranean spaces_for retiree reading groups._<sb/>_
_The “future”_of language,_or rather,_of those gestures_which align symbols_to produce_our shared, collective, readable utterances,_must be seen_against the background_of a long-standing tendency_to distrust_their alignment._<sb/>_
