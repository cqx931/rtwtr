The translation from surface into line implies a radical change of dimensionality with respect to the grasp of meaning.
The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus establishes reversible and arbitrary spatial relations between the elements of the image.
It may go back and forth while deciphering the image.
This spatiality of relations that prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who use images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it.
For them, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a reversible, spatial equivalence, and the world is structured by “eternal return.”
It is just as true to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing follows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as that death follows life.
The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as much as the rising sun calls the cock to crow.
In such a world, circular time orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced it will be readjusted by time itself.
Because to live is to displace things, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged in time.
This demands that we propitiate the order of the world, the “gods” of which it is full.
In sum: the “imagined” world may be a world of myth, of magic, an ahistorical world.
