 Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency

  and toward

  codes such as photographs, films,
-TV, screen-based graphic design in the service of social
  and 
-socialized media, and, generally,

  a

+tendency
  that
-is dominated by visuality, by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or “post-medium condition” which could, in principle if not in practice, be extended to the arts of language.

-This distrust and denial
  may be observed

  if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us.

-All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are archi-writing in Jacques Derrida’s sense.
~
-Iterable traces of actual language, all words are writing, as Derrida showed us.

-There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and genetically supported by aurality; by cultural predominance, “historically” supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.

+consciousness,”
  History began with the 
-authoritative emergence
+invention
  of 
-writing in visuality,
+writing,
  not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not
-necessarily
  perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive 
-symbols that persist as writing.
~
-“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.
~
-The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted
+symbols,
  by
-oral cultures – are every bit as “historical” as the effects of literal or letteral
  writing.

 If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the 
+original
  purpose of
-this early conventional
  writing was to facilitate the 
-reading
+deciphering
  of images.
~
 Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus.
~
 <ub>
~
 The “cuneiform” symbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they 
-accompany.
+ac­ company.
~
 They “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it.
~
-They provide it with an evocalization.
~
 </ub>
~
 They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text,
-the vocabulary of an utterance,
  by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within the image.
~
 It may be shown through text 
-analysis, through reading,
+analysis
  that the 
+original
  purpose of
-such
  writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a single dimension, is still there:
-Every text,
  every 
-utterance,
+text,
  even a very abstract one,
-also
  means, in the last analysis, an image.
~
 <sb/>
~
 
~
 The translation from surface into line implies a radical change of
-dimensionality with respect to the grasp of
  meaning.
~
 The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus establishes reversible
-and arbitrary spatial
  relations between the elements of the image.
~
 It may go back and forth while deciphering the image.
~
 This 
-spatiality
+reversibility
  of relations that prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who use images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it.
~
 For them, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a 
-reversible, spatial equivalence,
+reversible way,
  and 
-the
+their
  world is structured by “eternal return.”
~
 It is just as true to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing follows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as that death follows life.
~
 The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as much as the rising sun calls the cock to crow.
~
 In such a world, circular time orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced it will be readjusted by time itself.
~
 Because to live is to displace things, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged in time.
~
 This demands that 
-we
+man
  propitiate the order of the world, the “gods” of which it is full.
~
 In sum: the “imagined” world is the world of myth, of magic, the 
-ahistorical
+prehistorical
  world.
~
 <sb/>
~
 
~
 The eye that 
-reads
+deciphers
  a 
-text, the ear that reads to hear and understand a voice,
+text
  follows its lines, and thus establishes 
-an evocalized
+the univocal
  relation 
+of a chain
  between the elements of which the 
-language
+text
  is composed.
~
 Those who 
-lend authority to inscribed
+use
  texts
-in order
  to understand the world, those who “conceive” it, mean a world with a linear structure.
~
 Everything in such a world follows from something, time flows irreversibly from the past toward the future, each instant lost is lost forever, and there is no repetition.
~
 Each day is different from every other day, each sowing has its own characteristics, if there is life after death it must be a new sort of life, and the links of the causal chain cannot be exchanged one for the other.
~
 In such a world, every human act is unique, and 
-we are
+man is
  responsible for it.
~
 The elements of such a world are, at least theoretically, distinct from each other like the beads on a string, and they can be counted.
~
 On the other hand, the string that orders the beads, the “univocal flow of time,” is what holds such a world together.
~
 In sum: the “conceived” world is the world of the religions, of salvation, of political commitment, of science, and of technology – the historical world.

 One may well ask why, six thousand years ago, 
+the
  effort was 
-expended
+made
  to substitute the world of conception for the world of imagination, why
-what we conventionally call
  writing 
-emerged in persistent authoritative gestures of inscription.
+was invented.
~
 One may ask this at present precisely because a “new civilization of 
-image”
+images”
  seems to be dawning.
~
 The answer is, of course: 
-because
+because, six thousand years ago, some
  people
-have always
  thought that some images needed explaining.
~
 Images are mediations between 
-ourselves
+man
  and 
-our
+his
  world, a 
-reality the unimaginably vast majority of which is
+world that has become
  inaccessible to 
-human perception.

~
 They are tools
-intended
  to overcome
-this fundamental
  human alienation: they are meant to permit action in a world in which 
-we cannot live
+man no longer lives
  immediately but that 
-we face.
+he faces.

 Cave paintings are meant to permit hunting of ponies, cathedral windows to permit praying to God, road maps to permit motoring, and statistical projections
-– now reconfigured by AI –
  to permit decision making.
~
 One must learn how to 
-read
+decipher
  those images, one must learn the conventions that give them their meaning, and one may commit mistakes.
~
 For instance: it would be a mistake to 
-read
+decipher
  road maps as if they were cave paintings (magic for hunting tourists), or as if they were projections (proposals to build roads).
~
 The “imagination” that produces road maps is not the same as the “imagination” that produces cave paintings and projections.
~
 Explaining images with the help of 
-persistent linguistic inscription
+texts
  may therefore be useful.

+there
  is

  for

  of 
-imagination with more or less persistence.

 There is in images, as in all mediations, a curious inherent dialectic.

-We see

  and

~
-Images
+They may
  come to constitute an imaginary world that no longer mediates between 
-us
+man
  and 
-our
+the
  world, but, on the contrary, 
-constrains and deludes us.
+imprisons man.
~
 Imagination 
-does not overcome alienation; it
+no longer overcomes alienation, but
  becomes hallucination, or double alienation.

 <ub>
~
-Images do not reveal; we
+No longer
  are 
-what they show us.
~
-We “adore” the images that we can see, even those
+such
  images 
-that we can see and
+tools, but man himself becomes a tool of his own tools; he “adores”
  the 
-world does not.
+images he himself has produced.

 </ub>
~
 It is against this idolatry of images, as a therapy against this double alienation, that 
-language cares for us.
~
-Some of those who first spoke to us
+writing was invented.
~
+The early writers
  in our 
-traditions

  – the prophets, for instance –

  this by committing themselves against idols and idol making.

 And so did Plato when he announced his hatred of what we now call the “plastic arts.”

  to save
