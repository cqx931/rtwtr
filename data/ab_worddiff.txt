 Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency 
-to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language (as perceptible phenomenon)
+away from linear codes such as writing
  and toward 
-multi-dimensional
+two-dimensional
  codes such as photographs, films,
-TV, screen-based graphic design in the service of social
  and 
-socialized media, and, generally,

  that

-All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are archi-writing in Jacques Derrida’s sense.

-Iterable traces of actual language, all words are writing, as Derrida showed us.

-There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and genetically supported by aurality; by cultural predominance, “historically” supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.

  History began with the

  of 
-writing in visuality,

  not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not

  perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive 
-symbols that persist as writing.
~
-“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.

-The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted
+symbols,
  by

  writing.
-This follows, clearly and simply, from post-Derridean thought.

-Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi-writing in aurality.

 If the art of writing

 If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the 
+original
  purpose of
-this early conventional
  writing was to facilitate the

  of images.

 Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus.

 The “cuneiform” symbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they

 They “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it.

 They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text,
-the vocabulary of an utterance,
  by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within the image.

 It may be shown through text 
-analysis, through reading,

  that the 
+original
  purpose of

  writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a single dimension, is still there:

  even a very abstract one,
