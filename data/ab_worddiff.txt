 This 
-“_writing through_”_ of Vilém Flusser_’_s _‘_The Future of Writing_,__’_ reconfiguring it so as to become John Cayley_’_s _‘_The Future of Language_,__’
+essay
  will not consider 
+the
  problems concerning
-any possible future for
  the 
-teaching or philosophizing
+future
  of 
-an
+teaching the
  art of 
-language
+writing
  in the face of the growing importance of 
-non_-_ or anti_-_linguistic
+nonliterate
  messages in our surroundings_,_ although those problems 
-have already
+will
  become 
-significant
+ever more important both
  in the so_-_called developed countries 
+and in societies where illiteracy is still widespread
 _._
~
 <ub>
~
 Instead_,_ it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems_:_ namely_,_ the tendency 
-to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language _(
+away from linear codes such
  as 
-perceptible phenomenon_)
+writing
  and toward 
-multi
+two
 _-_dimensional codes such as photographs_,_ films_,
-TV_,_ screen_-_based graphic design in the service of social and socialized media_,
 _ and 
-,_ generally
+TV
 _,_ a 
-conception of art and aesthetics
+tendency
  that
-is dominated by visuality_,_ by so_-_called _“_fine_”_ as _“_visual_”_ or _“_plastic_”_ art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or _“_post_-_medium condition_”_ which could_,_ in principle if not in practice_,_ be extended to the arts of language_._
~
-This distrust and denial
  may be observed
-everywhere
  if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us_.
-Literature is $50bn behind art_._
~
-The MoMAs in every province and metropolis are stuffed to their gills with hipsters_,_ gleeful families and young _“_artists_”_ while fewer and fewer deserted book malls provide desultory subterranean spaces for retiree reading groups_.

 The
-“
  future
-”
  of 
-language_,_ or rather
+writing
 _,_ of 
-those gestures
+that gesture
  which 
-align
+aligns
  symbols to produce 
-our shared_,_ collective_,_ readable utterances
+texts
 _,_ must be seen against the background of 
-a long_-_standing
+that
  tendency
-to distrust their alignment

-All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language_,_ all these gestures_,_ regardless of their perceptible support media are archi_-_writing in Jacques Derrida_’_s sense_._
~
-Iterable traces of actual language_,_ all words are writing_,_ as Derrida showed us_._
~
-There is always and only the _“_logic of the supplement_”_ with respect to the perceptible traces of language_,_ typically and genetically supported by aurality_;_ by cultural predominance_,_ _“_historically_”_ supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality_._

-The configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing
+Writing
  is an important
-subsidiary configuration of linguistic
  gesture_,_ because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called _“_historical consciousness_
-.
+,
 __”_ History began with the 
-authoritative emergence
+invention
  of writing
-in visuality
 _,_ not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past_,_ but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not
-necessarily
  perceived as a process_,_ _“_historically_,__”_ unless one signifies it by successive symbols
-that persist as writing_._
~
-_“_Writing_”_ in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous_._
~
-The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted by oral cultures – are every bit as _“_historical_”_ as the effects of literal or letteral writing_._
~
-This follows
 _,_ 
-clearly and simply_,_ from post_-_Derridean thought_._
~
-Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi_-
+by
  writing
-in aurality
 _._

 The difference between
-so_-_called
  prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter_,_ but that during history there are literate 
-persons
+men
  who experience_,_ understand_,_ and evaluate the world as a _“_becoming_
-.
+,
 __”_ 
-In what we prejudicially call _“
+whereas in
  prehistory 
-”_ this kind of
+no such
  existential

  attitude 
-has a different extension and scale with respect to the sum of human culture
+is possible

 If the art of writing
-(_in either sense_,_ post_-_Derridean or conventional_)
  were to fall into oblivion_,_ or if it were to become subservient to picture making _(_as in the _“_scriptwriting_”_ 
-of
+in
  films_)__,_ history in the 
-conventional _(_historically emergent_)
+strict
  sense of that term would be over
-,_ and perhaps it is

 If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles_,_ one can see that the 
+original
  purpose of
-this early conventional
  writing was to facilitate the 
-reading
+deciphering
  of images_._
~
 Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and _“_cuneiform_”_ symbols scratched into them with a stylus_._
~
 <ub>
~
 The _“_cuneiform_”_ symbols form lines_,_ and they obviously mean the image they 
-accompany
+ac­ company
 _._
~
 They _“_explain_,__”_ _“_recount_,__”_ _“_tell_”_ it_._
~
-They provide it with an evocalization_._
~
 </ub>
~
 They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines_,_ by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text_,
-the vocabulary of an utterance_,
 _ by rendering _“_explicit_”_ what was _“_implicit_”_ within the image_._
~
 It may be shown through text analysis
-,_ through reading_,
  that the 
+original
  purpose of
-such
  writing_,_ namely_,_ the transcoding of two_-_dimensional codes into a single dimension_,_ is still there_:
-Every text_,
 _ every 
-utterance
+text
 _,_ even a very abstract one_,
-also
 _ means_,_ in the last analysis_,_ an image_.
